Attempts to make typing nêhiyawêwin (Plains Cree) in Canadian Aboriginal
syllabics easier to do. It does this by defining digraphs (see |digraph|).

To use the digraphs, in Insert mode, type <C-k>. The next
two keys correspond to a digraph. The digraph will be replaced with the
appropriate Canadian Aboriginal syllabics vowel, syllable, or final.

Examples:
    To obtain ᒋ (ci),  type <C-k>ci
    To obtain ᐃ (i),   type <C-k>i.
    To obtain ᑘ (twê), type <C-k>We
    To obtain ᐦ (h),   type <C-k>h.
    To obtain ᕽ (hk),  type <C-k>hk

The digraphs are constructed in a systematic manner:

                                                *nehiyawewin-vowels*
To type a vowel, type <C-k> followed by one of "aieo" as the first character,
then "." for a short vowel or ":" for a long vowel as the second character.
Note that ᐁ /ê has no short vowel form, so it must be typed as <C-k>e:

Examples:
    To obtain ᐃ (i), type <C-k>i.
    To obtain ᐄ (î), type <C-k>i:
    To obtain ᐁ (ê), type <C-k>e:

                                                *nehiyawewin-syllables*
To type a syllable (consonant, followed by vowel), type the consonant's SRO
equivalent, followed by its vowel. If the syllable has a long vowel,
capitalize the vowel (exception: do not capitalize "e" for "ê"). If the
syllable has an intervening "w" between the consonant and the vowel,
capitalize the consonant.

Examples:
    To obtain ᑭ (ki),  type <C-k>ki
    To obtain ᑮ (kî),  type <C-k>kI
    To obtain ᑫ (kê),  type <C-k>ke
    To obtain ᑷ (kwi), type <C-k>Ki
    To obtain ᑹ (kwî), type <C-k>KI
    To obtain ᑵ (kwê), type <C-k>Ke

                                                *nehiyawewin-finals*
For all finals other than ᕽ (hk), type its SRO equivalent, followed by a
full-stop. The digraph for ᕽ (hk) is "hk".

Examples:
    To obtain ᑊ (p),  type <C-k>p.
    To obtain ᐟ (t),  type <C-k>t.
    To obtain ᐠ (k),  type <C-k>k.
    To obtain ᐨ (c),  type <C-k>c.
    To obtain ᒼ (m),  type <C-k>m.
    To obtain ᐣ (n),  type <C-k>n.
    To obtain ᐢ (s),  type <C-k>s.
    To obtain ᐦ (h),  type <C-k>h.
    To obtain ᐤ (w),  type <C-k>w.
    To obtain ᕀ (y),  type <C-k>y.
    To obtain ᕽ (hk), type <C-k>hk

                                                *nehiyawewin-medials*

The digraphs for medial ᓬ (l) and ᕒ (r) follow the same rules as finals,
namely, type its SRO equivalent, followed by a full stop.

Examples
    To obtain ᓬ (l),  type <C-k>l.
    To obtain ᕒ (r),  type <C-k>r.
